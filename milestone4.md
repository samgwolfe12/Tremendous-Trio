# Milestone 4

## A. High Fidelity Prototypes

### Prototype 1
- User Story: As a college student, I want to upload an image into a quiz on eLc because I need to show my work.<br>
- Detailed desciption: For this user story, we addessed the problem of a complex user interface by adding an "embed media" button at the bottom of the question. This embed media button will allow you to upload media from your computer to eLc directly and use Kalturas media viewer so that it is embedded to the question. This effectively removes the requirement of Kalturas tedious upload process.<br>

### Prototype 2
- User Story: As a college student, I want to record and upload a video for my homework submission because the assignment requires it.<br>
- Detailed desciption: For this user story, we addessed the problem of a complex user interface by adding a button in the add file menu to open Kaltura Capture and record video for assignment directly in the assignment submission page.<br>

### Prototype 3
- User Story: As a college student, I want to record and upload a video for my homework submission because the assignment requires it.<br>
- Detailed desciption: For this user story, we addessed the problem of a complex user interface by having a kaltura video player embedded on the assignments view submission page for each student when there is a video file submitted. This player will automatically add the media that is uploaded so that videos can be viewed without having to download each submission.<br>

## B. Testing Protocol

### Research question: Do users prefer minor visual improvements or an entire overhaul of an existing User Interface when dealing with Kaltura?

### B1

-	One of the main methodologies we would use in helping us answer this question properly would be a survey. The reason we chose to use a survey is that it can give users a very straightforward method for telling us what they do or do not like about our improvements to Kaltura. Another good thing about a survey is that users tend to be more honest when they know that their answers are anonymous as to not want to put a product down with their name being attached to that.

-	Another tool we would use will be focus groups. These groups would specify the exact alterations we made to the existing Kaltura and present the question, was this alteration enough or would an entire overhaul be necessary? Another important question to ask in a focus group would be, did the majority of the group feel that our changes were even needed in the first place? For instance, had many of these users faced similar issues while using the software?

-	Lastly, we would use a series of blind interviews using our platform with our current adjustments and then presenting the interviewee with our competitors’ software to perform the same tasks. The way this could be presented is that we would not label the software we are testing and use that of the competitors to Kaltura to see what the overall user experience was when testing each software. If there was a larger portion of interviewees that had more positive things to say about the other software, then we would possibly look in to changing the entire design as a whole.

### B2

  The purpose of this research would be to determine if our adjustments we made to Kaltura are “good enough” in the eyes of our users. The best way to test this would be using the methods we described in B1. We think the easiest way to go about collecting data to support our answering of the research question would be the use of anonymous surveys. The reason being is the user would have a straightforward procedure of being presented with the original design of Kaltura and then our design and ask which did they prefer. To fully answer the research question, one of the options in the survey would be that they preferred neither, as this would provide a definitive answer to the question we are asking. 
  Another good method for obtaining this information would be the use of focus groups as it would be a quick way to get a look at what a group of people prefer as opposed to just one user. The best way to perform this task would be to complete a series of tasks for the group with the existing Kaltura interface and then with our interface and ask which did they prefer. As with the surveys we would ask the group if they thought our adjustments were enough or would they just prefer to use something else entirely? Obviously doing a focus group during a pandemic would have its challenges however this could be easily maneuvered by simply performing this entire demonstration on either Microsoft Teams call or a Zoom call while screen sharing with the group. 
  Lastly it is important that we work around this set of tasks all while making sure the participants are given informed consent. While the survey and focus groups were given this right away with us detailing exactly the questions were asking and why, the blind interviews would be a bit more difficult as we are not directly sharing which product is ours in the testing. However, to get around this issue we are informing them that these are two different software and our goal is to determine which experience the user preferred. There is no gray area in this description.
