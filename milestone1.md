# Milestone 1
- Elc uses Kaltura for its online streaming platform. Our group finds the process of uploading media into elc through Kaltura is difficult and not intuitive. We believe that other students and instructors will agree. We have defined the problem to be the complexity of Kaltura’s user experience, especially in regards to how it is integrated into Learning Management Systems.
UGA provides a lot of information on how to upload media, which indicates that the process is not intuitive. In fact, many instructors send these instructions out prior to any testing to avoid issues during that time period. Many other learning managements systems (LMS) use Kaltura as well including d2l and Canvas. Therefore, the stakeholders are all students and instructors who use Kaltura through a LMS. In today’s age of technology, the number impacted is extremely high. Students may be asked to upload a handwritten diagram during an exam, or a submit a picture of their scratch paper for their math homework. During last year’s remote learning, Sam’s sister had to upload a drawing onto Canvas for her kindergarten class. Instructors not only have to upload their own media, but deal with the ramifications of any issues students have doing so.

- This problem is not uniquely a face-to-face problem as it comes up in a variety of circumstances, but it would definitely be useful if students and instructors were able to upload media easily during class. The following is an example of  how that complexity of the system may contribute to problems in a face-to-face environment.

- In a science class, college students are broken up into groups and asked to record a video explaining different topics. Once the videos are made, the instructor asks each group to upload their video into the discussion board on elc. She plans on using the second half of class to watch the student videos on the smart board and make comments. One group cannot figure out how to upload a video into their media. Another tries to post a YouTube link, but is not able to. Many groups upload their videos, but Kaltura cannot post it in the time allotted. The instructor spends the whole class helping students post their videos and does not get to the second half of the lesson.

- In this scenario, the result of Kaltura’s complexity is that the instructor is unable to present material the students need to learn. 

- Kaltura is the only paid video streaming platform provided to students and instructors. Although there are other free options available (YouTube, Facebook Live, etc), they possess disadvantages such as problematic licensing agreements, lack of technical support, and insertion of advertising.

- We went through many reviews of Kaltura to see if other people have similar complaints about the software itself. Multiple reviews mention the videos take a long time to upload through kaltura. Another common complaint is the degree of complexity as a platform.

- One review writes, “Kaltura needs some sort of software update to improve functionality, it is probably the most clunky software I have ever used. Examples of issues I have had with Kaltura include:… It unexpectedly quits regularly. I also has an issue with editing videos. This software and its integration into Canvas is beyond slow to the point of not functional.”

- Despite these complaints, there are many positive reviews as well. It is one of, if not the best rated online video platform for education purposes. It appears that the biggest problem with Kaltura is its integration with LMSs such as elc, Canvas, and d2l. One issue that might contribute to the complexity is that with the many features Kaltura offers, the important steps can be lost. People may also struggle to understand where to upload, and access their media as there is a designated Kaltura website as well as a “my media” option in user input sections on elc. Some people may find it harder based on their past experiences with technology. Ultimately, there could be many aspects that contribute to Kaltura’s “clunky” user experience.
