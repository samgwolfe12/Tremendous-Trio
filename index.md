#A. Task / Problem Definition

Introduce your problem.
Examine and describe your problem of study. Try to describe your problem using terms like properties, affordances, and signifiers. Why is it a problem? How is it theme-relevant? Use the Seven Stages of Action to describe a typical interaction related to your problem. How do you know this interaction is typical?

Identify your potential users.
What user population is affected by your problem of study? What related tasks do they perform? How would users benefit from a solution (not necessarily your solution) to your problem of study?


#B. Analysis of Existing Solutions

Describe existing solutions.
What existing solutions, products, and services currently relate to your problem of study? Have others already attempted to solve your exact problem or something similar? What are the pros and cons of each existing solution, product, or service? If a certain solution, product, or service is popular, then state that and justify why that’s the case – you might use published surveys or articles to help make your case.

Describe potential guidelines and solutions.
What guidelines or principles do these solutions, products, and services conform to, either officially or unofficially, if any? What guidelines or principles appropriately serve your users?

#C. Proposed Solution

Propose a solution.
Using points from (A) and (B), propose a design solution to your problem of study. Do not propose a solution that’s in search of a problem! At this stage, let the problem lead you to a solution. Try to describe your solution using terms like properties, affordances, and signifiers. How does your proposed solution compare to existing solutions?

How will you measure success?
You do not need to supply an evaluation for this milestone; however, you should discuss what criteria should be used to judge if your design is a success or not.

#D. Summary Video

Create a 5-10 minute video that summarizes the information in parts (A), (B), and (C). The creation of this video should involve all team members, and the video itself should contain credits at the end describing who did what.

NOTE: Your instructor recommends that you upload your video to a service like YouTube and use the “unlisted” setting, if available, so that only people who know the link to the video can view it. You should provide the link to the video in your milestone deliverable report; if your report is an HTML page, then you may embed the video into the page in addition to providing the link.
